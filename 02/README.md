## Exercise 02: Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below N that are multiples of 3 or 5, if N = 10, then we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N, with N is from input.

**Example**

```
$ ruby program.rb
Input N = 10
Sum = 23
```
