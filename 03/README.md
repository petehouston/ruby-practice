## Exercise 03: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

**1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...**

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed input value N > 0, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Example**

```
$ ruby program.rb
Limit N = 3
Sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than 3: 3

$ ruby program.rb
Limit N = 20
Sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than 3: 10

$ ruby program.rb
Limit N = 4000000
Sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than 3: 4613732
```
